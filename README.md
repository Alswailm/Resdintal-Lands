## Resdital Lands Dashboard

At the outset of this project, our objective was to construct a predictive model for the residential land market in the city of Riyadh, utilizing historical transaction data. To initiate the data collection process, we collaborated with "Aqarsas," a reliable source, which supplied us with comprehensive real estate transaction records spanning from 2015 to 2023. Subsequently, we undertook the task of processing and refining the obtained dataset, with the intention of constructing an interactive dashboard that would facilitate in-depth exploration of the data. Following the completion of the dashboard, we proceeded to develop the proposed model, ARIMA, which would serve as the foundation for predicting future trends in the residential land market.
